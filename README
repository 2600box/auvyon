WHAT IS IT?
===========

AuVyon collects little helpers to work with media data.

See https://github.com/pyroscope/auvyon/wiki for more.


INSTALLATION
============

First, install basic requirements as root, e.g. on Debian and similar distros:

    sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv libmpg123-dev libsndfile1-dev \
        imagemagick ffmpeg flac
    
If you can't find all of these packages for your distro, some features might not work.


Then, for installing a release version, just call

    easy_install auvyon

[NB: There currently *is* no release version]


Otherwise, to create a working directory from source, use

    git clone git://github.com/pyroscope/auvyon.git
    cd auvyon
    . ./bootstrap.sh

This creates a virtualenv with all dependencies and necessary tools installed.


To test waveform creation, use
    python -m auvyon.imaging.waveforms src/tests/data/Parrot_sketch.ogg 
    display src/tests/data/waveforms.jpg
